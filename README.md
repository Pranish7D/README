## **Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring**

### **6.1 API Integration**

**Open PageRank API**:
- **Purpose**: Open PageRank provides a public and transparent ranking of domains. This API is used in the project to assess domain reputation.
- **Features**:
  - Retrieve domain rankings.
  - Evaluate domain reputation based on PageRank metrics.
- **Usage**: The API is called to get the rank of a domain, which is then used in the domain reputation analysis to determine the credibility of the domain.
- **Documentation**: For more details on using the Open PageRank API, visit the [Open PageRank API Documentation](https://www.domcop.com/openpagerank/documentation).

### **6.2 Setup Instructions**

**1. Clone the Repository:**
   - Use Git to clone the repository containing the project code.
   - Open your terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd <project-directory>
     ```
   - Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your Git repository and `<project-directory>` with the name of the directory where the repository is cloned.

**2. Install Required Packages:**
   - Ensure that you have Python and pip installed.
   - Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the project. Run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - This command installs all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

**3. Update Constants in the Script:**
   - **IMAP_SERVER**: Specify the IMAP server address for your email provider. This address is required for the system to connect to your email server and retrieve emails.
   - **EMAIL**: Enter your email address which will be used to connect to the email server.
   - **PASSWORD**: Use an app-generated password for secure access to your email account. This is different from your regular email password and can usually be generated through your email provider’s security settings.
   - **API Key**: Replace `'your_api_key'` with your actual API key from Open PageRank. This key is used to authenticate requests to the Open PageRank API.

### **Example Configuration:**
```python
IMAP_SERVER = 'imap.your-email-provider.com'
EMAIL = 'your-email@example.com'
PASSWORD = 'your-app-generated-password'
OPEN_PAGE_RANK_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
```

**4. Additional Setup Notes:**
- **Environment Variables**: For security reasons, consider storing sensitive information like API keys and passwords in environment variables rather than hardcoding them in the script.
- **Testing**: After setup, test the integration by running a few example scripts to ensure that the connection to the IMAP server and API requests are functioning correctly.

## **Phase 7: Maintenance and Updates**

### **7.1 Regular Updates**
- **Model Updates:** Continuously update and retrain the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
- **Blacklist Updates:** Update the blacklist databases daily from trusted sources.
- **Certificate Updates:** Regularly update certificates and CRLs to manage risks from compromised certificates.

### **7.2 Feature Enhancements**
- **New Features:** Add features based on user feedback and emerging threats.
- **Security Assessments:** Conduct regular assessments to ensure the system remains secure and effective.
